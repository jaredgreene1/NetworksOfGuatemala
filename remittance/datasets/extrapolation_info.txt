Approx. Total Number of Households in Guatemala: 3297636.96
(found by using the 1981 measures the UN collected on the total population size of Guatemala and the total number of households, taking the ratio between
the two and then dividing the current Guatemalan population by this ratio to find the approx. current total of households in Guatemala)

3,297,636.96 / 11,536
= 285.856186 
(the factor by which the ENCOVI data should be multiplied by in order to extrapolate the data to the whole population)


As of a 2016 study, the average household size is 5.9, therefore, the factor changes significantly.
17,280,673 / 5.9 
= 2,928,927.63 (approx total number of current households in Guatemala)

2,928,927.63 / 11,536
= 253.894559
(the new factor by which the ENCOVI data should be multiplied by in order to extrapolate the data to the whole population)
